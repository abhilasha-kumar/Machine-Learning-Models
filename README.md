# Machine-Learning-Models
A collection of machine learning algorithms I wrote. These files include algorithms to implement the following models:

### Perceptron Learning Algorithm 
### Logistic Regression Model
### Bagged Decision Trees
### Random Forests
### Adaboost Algorithm
### Support Vector Machine Algorithm
